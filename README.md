# 🛒 Cart Discount Exercise

Welcome! In this exercise, you’ll work with an existing TypeScript module that calculates discounts for a shopping cart. The current implementation is functional but intentionally **overcomplicated, inconsistent, and repetitive**.

Your goal is to **refactor the code for clarity, maintainability, and extensibility** — without changing its external behavior (all tests should continue to pass).

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

```bash
# Pull down repo
git clone https://github.com/n8io/hear-com-interviews.git && cd hear-com-interviews

# Ensure you're using the proper Node version
nvm install

# Install dependencies:
npm install

# Run tests
npm test
``` 

## ✅ Your Tasks

1. Identify code smells
2. Talk through your thought process, share your intent with the interviewer
3. Refactor the code
4. Do not modify any of the existing tests, assume they are stable and correct. You may add some if you so choose.
5. Autocomplete is fine, but for this exercise we prefer you DO NOT use chat/AI based tools to do the work.

🤝 Good luck — we’re excited to see how you approach making this code better!
